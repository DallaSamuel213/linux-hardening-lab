Linux Hardening Lab — CyberJKD
Target System: Kali Linux (WSL2 on Windows)
Date: March 14, 2026
Author: Samuel Dalla (CyberJKD)
Phase: Roadmap Phase 1 — Systems Foundation

Overview
This document details the systematic hardening of a Kali Linux installation running on WSL2, completed as Phase 1 of the CyberJKD cybersecurity learning roadmap. The objective was to reduce the attack surface, disable unnecessary services, configure firewall rules, harden SSH access, and secure sensitive file permissions. All changes are documented as a reproducible checklist that can be applied to any Debian-based Linux system.
The approach follows a simple principle — audit first, change second, verify third. No change was made without understanding why it matters.

Baseline Audit
Before any changes were made a full audit was conducted to understand the current state of the system.
Open ports before hardening:
PortServiceRisk53DNS (WSL2 internal)Low — internal only323chronyd time syncLow — localhost only3350xrdp session managerMedium — unnecessary service3389RDP daemonHigh — exposed on all interfaces
Running services before hardening:
ServiceStatusxrdpRunning — unnecessaryxrdp-sesmanRunning — unnecessarylightdmRunning — unnecessary on WSL2rtkit-daemonRunning — unnecessarycronRunning — requireddbusRunning — requiredpolkitRunning — requiredunattended-upgradesRunning — beneficial, keptcore systemd servicesRunning — required
Key finding: Port 3389 RDP was exposed on all interfaces with no restriction. RDP is one of the most commonly targeted services in real-world attacks — used for brute force, credential stuffing, and exploitation of known vulnerabilities such as BlueKeep. Its presence on a default installation with no firewall represents a significant unnecessary risk.

Hardening Actions
1. Disabled Unnecessary Services
Four services were identified as unnecessary and disabled:
bashsudo systemctl stop xrdp
sudo systemctl disable xrdp
sudo systemctl stop xrdp-sesman
sudo systemctl disable xrdp-sesman
sudo systemctl stop lightdm
sudo systemctl disable lightdm
sudo systemctl stop rtkit-daemon
sudo systemctl disable rtkit-daemon
```

| Service | Reason for Disabling |
|---|---|
| xrdp | RDP not required — was exposing port 3389 on all interfaces |
| xrdp-sesman | Dependency of xrdp — no longer needed |
| lightdm | Display manager unnecessary on a headless WSL2 environment |
| rtkit-daemon | Realtime scheduling not required for this system |

**Note:** unattended-upgrades was left running. Automatic security updates are a defensive control — disabling them would reduce security not improve it.

### 2. SSH Hardening

Configuration file modified: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

Four settings were hardened:
```
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
X11Forwarding no
MaxAuthTries 3
SettingValue SetReasonPermitRootLoginnoPrevents direct root login over SSH — attackers cannot target root directlyPasswordAuthenticationnoForces key-based authentication only — eliminates brute force via passwordX11ForwardingnoDisables GUI forwarding over SSH — unnecessary and increases attack surfaceMaxAuthTries3Limits failed authentication attempts — slows brute force attempts
SSH service restarted to apply changes:
bashsudo service ssh restart

3. Firewall Configuration
Tool used: ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall)
bashsudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
```

| Rule | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Default incoming | Deny | Block all unsolicited inbound connections |
| Default outgoing | Allow | System can initiate outbound connections normally |
| Port 22 SSH | Allow | Explicitly permit SSH — only intentional open port |

Verified with `sudo ufw status verbose`:
```
Status: active
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing)
22/tcp    ALLOW IN    Anywhere

4. File Permission Hardening
Sensitive system files were checked and permissions set to secure values:
bashsudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow
sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd
sudo chmod 640 /etc/group
sudo chmod 600 /etc/gshadow
FilePermissionsReason/etc/shadow600Contains password hashes — root read/write only/etc/passwd644User account info — readable by all, writable by root only/etc/group640Group membership info — restricted read/etc/gshadow600Group password hashes — root only

5. User Security Checks
Three critical checks were performed:
Check 1 — Empty passwords:
bashsudo awk -F: '($2 == "") {print $1}' /etc/shadow
Result: No output — no accounts with empty passwords found.
Check 2 — Unauthorized UID 0 accounts:
bashawk -F: '($3 == "0") {print $1}' /etc/passwd
Result: Only root holds UID 0 — no unauthorized privilege escalation risk found.
Check 3 — World-writable files in /etc:
bashsudo find /etc -type f -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null
```
Result: No output — no world-writable files found in /etc.

## Post-Hardening Audit

**Open ports after hardening:**

| Port | Service | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 53 | DNS (WSL2 internal) | Unchanged — expected |
| 323 | chronyd | Unchanged — localhost only, low risk |
| 22 | SSH | Intentional — locked down with key-only auth |
| 3350 | xrdp-sesman | Removed from attack surface |
| 3389 | RDP | Removed from attack surface |

**Ports 3389 and 3350 are completely gone.**

Key Takeaways
A default Kali Linux installation is not production-hardened. RDP was exposed on all interfaces, unnecessary services were running, and SSH was configured with permissive defaults. Through systematic auditing and hardening the attack surface was significantly reduced.
Three principles drove every decision in this lab:
Least privilege — every service, user, and file permission was reduced to the minimum necessary to function.
Attack surface reduction — if a service is not needed it should not be running. Every open port is a potential entry point.
Audit before action — understanding the baseline state before making changes is what separates disciplined security work from guesswork.
This process mirrors real-world Linux server hardening procedures used by security engineers and system administrators in enterprise environments. The same checklist can be adapted and applied to Ubuntu, Debian, or any other Debian-based production server.
